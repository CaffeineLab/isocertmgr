# ISO Certificate Manager
Ever get tired of scouring machines for certificates?  Get tired of sorting out the serial number of the proper cert because Chrome doesn't always display the friendly name?  Well, this tool is for you.


Goal:
Simply want a way to export relevant certificates and the important data for energy markets (MISO, ERCOT, PJM, SPP) and OATI.

Supported ISOs:
    ERCOT
    
    Others coming shortly.
